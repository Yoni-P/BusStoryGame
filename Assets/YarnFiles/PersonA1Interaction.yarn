Love is a madness most discreet, consuming hearts in silent flames, where reason yields to passion's sweet embrace.

-> What?
    Sorry, did you say something?

-> Yes, I asked if I can pass you
    True love doth ne'er run smooth, yet 'tis a balm that soothes the wounds of time, knitting souls in fate's eternal dance.
-> What did you say?
    *Sigh* Sometimes true love is just two steps to your left.
